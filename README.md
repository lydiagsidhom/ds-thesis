# UC Berkeley Data Science Honors Thesis 24-25
_Lydia Sidhom_

This project is for the undergraduate Data Science Honors Thesis program in the academic year 2024-25. It is an investigation into individual judge behavior in criminal trials in New York State. Judges in criminal cases in the United States are tasked with making a decision at a defendant’s arraignment – such as setting bail, remanding them to jail, or releasing them on their own recognizance. This decision is based on a judge’s prediction of a defendant’s supposed flight risk. The project aims to examine if there is prejudice based on race, gender, and/ or socioeconomic status in this decision.
