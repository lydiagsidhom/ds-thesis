# Data
This folder contains the data for reproducing the analysis in the thesis. It is the publicly available New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services pretrial release data. It contains the original form of the files in CSV format, where each year (2019 to 2023) is stored in its own CSV file. It also contains a file called `alldata` which is the concatenated dataset of all years; the code for this can be found in the `combined` notebook in the `Jupyter notebooks` folder of this repo.
